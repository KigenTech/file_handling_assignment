### Explanation:

1. File Creation: The script creates a file named `"my_file.txt"` in write mode and writes three lines of text to it.

2. File Reading and Display: The script then reads the content of the file and displays it on the console.

3. File Appending: The script opens the file in append mode and adds three more lines of text.

4. Error Handling: The script includes error handling to manage potential issues like `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and any other unexpected exceptions. The `finally` block ensures that a message is printed indicating the completion of file handling operations.
